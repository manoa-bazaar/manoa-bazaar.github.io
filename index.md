## Goals
A big problem many students face is the high turnover rate of goods purchased throughout their semesters at UH Manoa. Our goal is to create an interface to help students buy and sell products easily.

--
UHM students have a “rapid” churn rate in goods and services. Students leave the dorm for an on-campus apartment and need to get rid of dorm-specific stuff and acquire apartment-specific stuff. Students graduate and need to get rid of stuff because they’re moving off-island. There is therefore a tremendous amount of “campus-specific” goods and services that could be more effectively recycled and reused if there was an effective marketplace for these specific kinds of items.
