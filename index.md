## Overview
//Basic summary of the application

## Goals
A big problem many students face is the high turnover rate of goods purchased throughout their semesters at UH Manoa. Our goal is to create an interface to help students buy and sell products easily.

--
UHM students have a “rapid” churn rate in goods and services. Students leave the dorm for an on-campus apartment and need to get rid of dorm-specific stuff and acquire apartment-specific stuff. Students graduate and need to get rid of stuff because they’re moving off-island. There is therefore a tremendous amount of “campus-specific” goods and services that could be more effectively recycled and reused if there was an effective marketplace for these specific kinds of items.

## Features

### Landing page  
The landing page is presented to users when they visit the top-level URL to the site.
It displays a list of most highly viewed items that are currently being sold at the top level, followed by categories that display related items.

### Categories page 
The categories page shows ths users 5 categories: textbooks, kitchenware, bedroom items, school supplies, and other items. The first 4 categories contain items that fall into each of the categories, and the "other items" category holds items that don't belong in any of the other categories. Clicking on each of these categories takes you to a page of that category, where the items are listed. This is a basic example of what the categories page will look like. Obviously it will be in style with the whole page, but for right now it is black and white because we haven't defined our theme yet.

when you click on the category you are looking for, it will take you to a page where the items for that category are listed. For example, the textbook items page shows a list of the different subjects, and then you can click on each subject and see what books are offered in that category. When you click on the textbooks category, an example page of what you could get is this:
